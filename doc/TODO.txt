think of different name.

Reconsider if we want a send log default, or if it should be optional.

Rename send -> put ?

Post quantum crypto. Preshared keys? Preshared keys mixed with key derivation?

Ways to tune chunking algorithm. Fixed size/others? Min size/max size?

ARCHIVIST_CONNECT/ARCHIVIST_PROXY/???="ssh foo.com/archivist serve"

Prefetch system should also work for non leaf tree nodes. htree peek api?

Improve documentation on key exchange packet and 'box' structure.

Tests shouldn't depend on bash.

Should allow running of single tests.

Protocol, add specific sync message for use with checkpointing code.

Default tags? A way to set custom default tags?

Handle ctrl+c gracefully in archivist serve during gc. It would be nice if

editing of items - work out a scheme that is either backwards compatible, OR implement it.

busy timeout or other mechanism for send log and query cache.

consider/benchmark PRAGMA synchronous.

consider/prototype changing encoding scheme to bare.
