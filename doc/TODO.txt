think of different name.

Reconsider if we want a send log default, or if it should be optional.

Rename send -> put ?

Post quantum crypto. Preshared keys? Preshared keys mixed with key derivation?

Ways to tune chunking algorithm. Fixed size/others? Min size/max size?

ARCHIVIST_CONNECT/ARCHIVIST_PROXY/???="ssh foo.com/archivist serve"

Prefetch system should also work for non leaf tree nodes. htree peek api?

Split encrypted metadata and unencrypted so gc doesn't need to fetch encrypted metadata?

Improve documentation on key exchange packet and 'box' structure.

Tests shouldn't depend on bash.

Should allow running of single tests.

Sendlog + Statcache should NOT be invalidated by gc. We could instead only allow

(see above.)

Default tags? A way to set custom default tags? 

(mime)type tag - A way to see what the actual contents of a snapshot are.

Handle ctrl+c gracefully in archivist serve during gc. It would be nice if

refactor, make additem its own protocol message, this way item_id can be omitted from other ops?
Maybe not worth it.

editing of items?
