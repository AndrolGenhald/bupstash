Need to do:

- think of different name.
- Rename send -> put ?
- ARCHIVIST_CONNECT/ARCHIVIST_PROXY/???="ssh foo.com archivist serve -r /foo"
- Improve documentation on key exchange packet and 'box' structure.
- Detailed and nice man pages, scdoc.
- Editing of items - work out a scheme that is either backwards compatible, OR implement it.
- Rename send-log to --cache ?
- Tweak cli? ' put ./foo ' is confusing, perhaps this should be an error? alt syntax?

Can do later (medium term):

- Remote init.

- Upload progress indicator.

- GC progress indicator.

- Post quantum crypto. Preshared keys? Preshared keys mixed with key derivation?

- Upload checkpointing/resume? A checkpoint should be invalidated by the gc generation, but
  lets us remember things we already sent. Protocol, add specific sync message for use with checkpointing code. If we add this,
  we can add checkpointing later perhaps.

- Tests shouldn't depend on bash.

- Should allow running of single cli tests.

- Ways to tune chunking algorithm.
  - Fixed size chunking?
  - Min size/max size/average size?
  - Alternative chunking algorithms?

- busy timeout or other mechanism for send log and query cache.

- Handle ctrl+c gracefully in archivist serve during gc. It would be nice if
  we can avoid the gc quiescent period on proper shutdown.

- Concurrent garbage collector, walk htrees in parallel and/or walk multiple entries
  in parallel.

- Sparse file support in snapshots.

Long term:

  - External backends.

Unclassified:

- use WITHOUT ROWID in address table in sendlog.

- Prefetch system should also work for non leaf tree nodes.

- consider/benchmark PRAGMA synchronous.

- Writing to broken pipe for 'list' and 'put' should be a failure, but not a panic or error message.
