Need to do:

- Rename send -> put ?
- Improve documentation on key exchange packet and 'box' structure.
- Detailed and nice man pages, scdoc.
- Editing of items - work out a scheme that is either backwards compatible, OR implement it.
- Rename send-log to --cache ?
- Tweak cli? ' put ./foo ' is confusing, perhaps this should be an error? alt syntax?
- RRequestChunk optional in reply?
- Init should respect BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY.
- init should work for remote repositories.
- Metadata must track sending key id in case we need to audit it.
- change name to no-stat-caching
- Verify we handle atime correctly when snapshotting.
- Hardlink support
- timestamp in encrypted metadata header instead of tags?
- Add gc generation fence.
- Torture test in cli suite for send checkpointing.
- Allow user to specify checkpoint duration.

- Send permission denied: Permission denied (os error 13), add path.

Can do later (medium term):

- Localization
  - tests for localized tags.

- Remote init.

- Upload progress indicator.

- GC progress indicator.

- Post quantum crypto. Preshared keys? Preshared keys mixed with key derivation?

- Upload checkpointing/resume? A checkpoint should be invalidated by the gc generation, but
  lets us remember things we already sent. Protocol, add specific sync message for use with checkpointing code. If we add this,
  we can add checkpointing later perhaps.

- Tests shouldn't depend on bash.

- Should allow running of single cli tests.

- busy timeout or other mechanism for send log and query cache.

- Handle ctrl+c gracefully in bupstash serve during gc. It would be nice if
  we can avoid the gc quiescent period on proper shutdown.

- Concurrent garbage collector, walk htrees in parallel and/or walk multiple entries
  in parallel.

- Sparse file support in snapshots.

- Writing to broken pipe for 'list' and 'put' should be a failure, but not a panic or error message.

- External backends.

Long term:

- Ways to tune chunking algorithm.
  - Fixed size chunking?
  - Min size/max size/average size?
  - Alternative chunking algorithms?


Unclassified:

- Prefetch system should also work for non leaf tree nodes.

- consider/benchmark PRAGMA synchronous.
