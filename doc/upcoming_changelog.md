# Bupstash v0.12.0

We are proud to bring you the next iteration of bupstash, this update contains a large amount of
performance work that should speed up `bupstash put` in many situations.

This release also contains an important bug fix, so upgrading is strongly recommended.

## New features

- The deduplication rolling hash algorithm has been improved and is now 30 to 50 percent faster.
- Those using a nightly rust compiler can enable SIMD (even faster) rolling hash implementations.
- A multithreaded `bupstash put` implementation has been added that can read, hash, compress, encrypt files in parallel.
- New flags have been added to `bupstash put` to tune how bupstash uses cpu threads.
- Bupstash diff and bupstash restore can now use multiple threads when computing changes on the local disk.

## Notable Bug fixes

- A bug that cause bupstash to not detect io errors in certain situations has been fixed.

## Incompatibilities

- It is likely your repositories will grow in size if they contain data chunks from previous
  versions of bupstash, this can be fixed by cycling older data out over time, or recreating your backups.
- Because the chunks generated by bupstash will change, expect increased bandwidth usage until
  the new chunks are uploaded.
- Bupstash is now biased to produce 2 MiB data chunks on average instead of 1 MiB chunks (in the future this  may become configurable).

## Supporting bupstash

Bupstash.io managed repositories are in open beta and anyone can create an account.
