# Bupstash v0.12.0

This release contains a large amount of performance work that can *dramatically* speed up `bupstash put` in the right conditions.
This release also contains an important bug fix, so upgrading is strongly recommended.

## New features

- The deduplication rolling hash algorithm has been improved and is now faster 30 to 50 percent faster.
- Those using a nightly rust compiler can enable SIMD (even faster) rolling hash implementations.
- New multithreaded upload implementation has been added that can *dramatically* improve upload performance at times.
- New flags have been added to `bupstash put` to tune how bupstash uses cpu threads.

## Notable Bug fixes

- A bug that cause bupstash to not detect io errors in certain situations has been fixed.

## Incompatibilities

- It is likely your repositories will temporarily grow in size if they contain data chunks from previous
  versions of bupstash, this can be fixed by cycling older data out over time, or recreating your backups.
- Because the chunks generated by bupstash will change slightly, expect increased bandwidth usage until
  the new chunks are uploaded.
