bupstash put [OPTIONS] TAGS... [:: WHAT]

Put an entry into a bupstash repository with an associated set of metadata tags.
WHAT may be a file or directory or a command to run if --exec is provided.

When WHAT is a directory, it is automatically converted to a tarball using
an efficient caching mechansim.

To best utilize the put caching mechanism, give each job you intend to run
repeatedly it's own send log. This can dramatically reduce the amount of 
disk reading and network usage required to make a snapshot.

Examples:
  $ export BUPSTASH_REPOSTORY=$HOME/bupstash-repo
  $ export BUPSTASH_KEY=./my-secret-bupstash.key

  # To avoid resending data needlessly during backups, create job specific send log.
  $ bupstash put --send-log /root/backup-sendlog :: ./to-backup

  # Specify arbitrary metadata as KEY=VALUE before ::.
  $ bupstash put host=$(hostname) :: ./file.txt

  # Use --exec to save the output of commands.
  $ bupstash put --exec name=files.tar :: tar -C ./files -cvf - .

  # If WHAT is not specified, it is read from stdin.
  $ echo data | bupstash put
