bupstash gc [OPTIONS]

Run the garbage collector against a repository, removing
unreferenced data and freeing disk space.

'put' and 'get' operations will be blocked during periods while garbage collection
is in progress.

Examples:
  $ bupstash gc -r ./backups
  $ bupstash gc -r ssh://$server/repository
