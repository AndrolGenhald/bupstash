bupstash new-send-key

Description:
  Create a new send key readable by the creating user.

  The send key is derived from a key generated via new-key.
  The primary key will be able to decrypt data written by the generated key.

  Keep this key secure, it is not able to decrypt archived data, but should
  still be kept private.

  Note, each send key has it's own data 'deduplication space'. If you share
  send keys across multiple machines, you will get more data deduplication,
  but will leave your shared data more vulnerable to corruption by malicious
  uploads from compromised clients. 

Quick examples:
  $ bupstash new-key -o ./backups.key
  $ bupstash new-send-key -k ./backups.key -o ./send-only-backup.key

Usage:
  bupstash new-send-key [OPTIONS]
