Archivist new-send-key: Create a new send key.

Description:

  Creates a new send key and writes it to disk with permissions
  by the creating user. The send key is derived from a master key,
  the master will be able to decrypt data written by the generated key.

  Keep this key secure, it is not able to decrypt archived data, but should
  still be kept private.

  Note, each send key has it's own data 'deduplication space'. If you share
  send keys across multiple machines, you will get better data deduplication,
  but will leave your data more vulnerable to attackers wishing to corrupt
  future data streams (They will still not be able to corrupt previously archived data). 

Quick examples:

  $ archivist new-master-key -o ./backups-master.key
  $ archivist new-send-key -m ./backups-master.key -o ./backups-server1.key
