bupstash new-sub-key [OPTIONS]

Generate a bupstash sub key with lesser encryption and decryption capabilities.

*NOTE*: decryption differs from access - An attacker may still
delete data by simply deleting the items or files they have access
to. Use `bupstash serve` access controls to restrict what operations
a user can perform and prevent unauthorized deletion of data.

Examples:
  $ bupstash new-key -o ./backups.key
  $ bupstash new-sub-key --put -k ./backups.key -o ./put.key
  $ bupstash new-sub-key --list -k ./backups.key -o ./list.key
  $ bupstash new-sub-key --list-contents -k ./backups.key -o ./list.key
